# Tidal-Link-Converter
A simple private HTML web page that converts standard links from Tidal into an alternative URL structure compatible with the tidal.qqdl.site domain.

# Description
This tool reformats official Tidal URLs into an alternative domain structure to allow direct access to specific releases. In some cases, the original platform interface may make it difficult to locate certain versions of singles, albums, or regional releases. This converter is designed to help users quickly generate a reformatted link when searching for specific editions.

The application runs entirely on the client side and does not host, store, or distribute any media content. It simply performs a URL transformation based on a predefined pattern.
